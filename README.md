# fibonacci_methods
This is a program that calucaltes the fobanacci numbers using user input in a cache, LRU cache, iterative and recursive way. 
There is also another text.txt file that has an int inside which is used in the main program to calculate fib + integer 

example if want to calculate the 6th fib number, it will do 6 + interger_inside_the_text.txt

thank you
